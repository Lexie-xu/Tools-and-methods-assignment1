## Research question
Effective integration of geospatial information in the conceptual model of ancient Chinese pottery inscriptions constructed based on metadata and ontology to deepen the understanding of inscription contexts
## Explanation
Integration of pottery inscribed information by creating a dataset that combines its geographic information. It is possible to explore the differences in the contents and styles of inscriptions on the same or different types of pottery in the same or different regions.
## Required data
| Item | Element | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1    | Title   | Records of titling and other titles. | 
| 2    | Type of texture | Records of the main material or texture, such as earthenware, porcelain, and glazed pottery. | 
| 3    | Current location | Records of the current location. The location within non-public buildings is confidential. |
| 4    | Production place | Records of the place of production, such as the name and location of the kiln site. |
| 5    | Related events | Record of related events, such as those during the process of production, utilization, and circulation. |
| 6    | Related people | Records of related people, such as the creator, user, and collector. |
| 7    | Inscriptions | Specifics of inscriptions on pottery |
